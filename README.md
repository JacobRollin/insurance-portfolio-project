# US Medical Insuraance Portfolio Project
US Medical Insurance portfolio project from Codecademy's Data Analyst career path
## Goals
The goals of this project are outlined in the notebook file in the repository as well, but here they are briefly:
* Use data analysis skills and python to analyze a real world dataset
* Outline some potential hypotheses and use data analysis to find some answers
* Complete a project to be used for portfolio purposes in the future
***
The project can be found by opening the .ipynb file.  
As of right now, this project is complete. I may add more to it in the future but for now, it will remain as is.
